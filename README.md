This is a prototype. Stuff will change.

#### App

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

`http://localhost:3000` shows the editor prototype

`http://localhost:3000/state` shows the different transformed states

#### Bundle analysis

```
npm run analyze
```

`http://127.0.0.1:888[8|9]/` shows a graphic representation of a webpack bundle.

For now, simply a copy of [this next config](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-webpack-bundle-analyzer)
